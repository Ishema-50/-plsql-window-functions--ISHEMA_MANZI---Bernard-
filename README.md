<h3>Database development with PLSQL</h3>
this read me contains how i did my database development with PLSQL work in this UCI week where <br/>
did not attend the physical class. <br/>

<h3>Question 1</h3>
this question was about the problem definition i used to identify the problem <br/>
in a shop i called ishema_shop that sells agriculture products like fruit juice and so many <br/>
problems like  it is hard to monitor how customers purchases in different times <br/><br/>

1.	business context

I’m going to use the company called ISHEMA-SHOP that sells food products like rice, fruit juice and so many agriculture products.

Company type: Food trading & Distribution company.
Industry: food and agriculture industry.

2.	Data challenges

Through this business ISHEMA-SHOP faces some challenges like it is hard to find which agriculture item is more liked than others in different regions and seasons( perform the best) , and it is hard to monitor how customers purchases in different times, and it hard to maintain how items are remain in the stock.
  And it is hard to keep hard copies of the transactions because they are lost and even damaged.

3.	Exepected outcome

Decision I’m going to make a database that will hold and keep all business data that will help the manager to generate reports quickly and identify top products and performs the best among others ,and generate each month income and growth and avoid missing of business information because data are kept safe in the database.

<h3>Qustion 6</h3>
Insights
1.	descriptive: <br/>
                    what happened “in this shop they faced problems of find some reports based on their products like which product performs the most in different regions and different seasons.”

Also it was difficult to find total earned for every salary.

2.	diagnostic: <br/>
                  why  ”in this shop based on work they did not have a database that keep their records and reports and will help them to easily perform those calculations.

3.	prescriptive: <br/>
                   what next “the next thing to overcome that problem is to create a database that will help them to store data easily and have protection and put some functions to quickly generate those output they want. <br/><br/>
